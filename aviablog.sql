It is also a leading producer of military&nbsp;aircraft,&nbsp;helicopters, space vehicles, and&nbsp;missiles, a standing significantly&nbsp;enhanced&nbsp;with the company&rsquo;s acquisition of the aerospace and defense units of Rockwell International Corporation in 1996 and its merger with McDonnell Douglas Corporation in 1997. Formerly Boeing Airplane Company, the firm assumed its current name in 1961 to reflect its expansion into fields beyond aircraft manufacture.

The only clue is the building&#39;s size. It&#39;s gargantuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It needs to be. Because it contains something equally vast -- the largest airplane that was never completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aircraft is an Antonov An-225, conceived by Soviet engineers in the dying days of the Cold War as a gigantic, gravity-defying workhorse that would help communism&#39;s ongoing race into space and assert the East&#39;s dominance of the skies.Only one An-225 was ever built by the Kiev-based Antonov company, which came up with the design. Romantically named Mriya, (Ukranian for dream), it first took flight in 1988 and has been in service ever since, drawing crowds of admirers wherever it spreads its huge wings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Construction was begun on a second plane, a sister for this aerial leviathan. But while Mriya is breaking world records in the skies, her twin still lies in pieces, only able to dream about leaving the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fate of Mriya&#39;s hidden sister is a fascinating story about big ambitions and even bigger frustrations caught up in the turbulent history of modern Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story isn&#39;t over though. Antonov remains optimistic it&#39;ll get the second An-225 off the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reaching the unfinished An-225&#39;s hangar involves being escorted by car through the vast industrial landscape west of Kiev that Antonov occupies. Entering the building is like stepping into a cathedral of mechanics -- it&#39;s surprisingly calm and tranquil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cavernous, endless space swallows up the machinery and airplane parts within. Workers can occasionally be glimpsed in the distance, but the sound of their activity is lost, absorbed by the giant metallic structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Towering over everything is the massive fuselage of the unfinished An-225. It&#39;s a beast of a thing. If ever completed, it will have a length of 84 meters (276 feet) -- a whole 9 meters longer than the world&#39;s largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380 superjumbo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s an impressive sight, although it is slightly depressing to see this potentially majestic airplane in pieces. The wings that would give it a span of 88.4 meters are unattached, stretching off to one side. The nose gear, a mechanism the size of a house, is also nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how did it get here?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of the An-225 begins back in the 1960 and &#39;70s when the Soviet Union was locked in a race into space with the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It recently granted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel\">CNN Travel</a>&nbsp;an exclusive tour of the half-built aircraft, an intriuging glimpse at the legacy of one of the marvels of the modern aviation world.</p>\r\n', '2019-04-27 19:19:48', 'static\\images\\3.jpg'),

In light of the use of latest technologies aircraft has many advantages in operation, economical in fuel consumption and has a comfortable environment for passengers. This liner is different from other aircrafts as technical and operational parameters on.

The system can transmit images from the LANTIRN targeting pod and display video imagery to the cockpit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USAF F-16 aircraft receive the Boeing joint helmet-mounted cueing system (JHMCS), currently in full-rate production. Deliveries of production systems began in 2004, and the system was first deployed operationally during Operation Iraqi Freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>F-16 missiles and weapons</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The aircraft has nine hardpoints for weapons payloads: one at each wing tip, three under each wing and one centreline under the fuselage. The ordnance is launched from Raytheon LAU-88 launchers, MAU-12 and Orgen bomb ejector racks. The port wing is fitted with a 20mm General Electric M61A1 multi-barrel cannon and the gunsight is interfaced to the cockpit HUD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Air-to-air missiles which have been carried on the F-16 include the Lockheed Martin / Raytheon AIM-9 Sidewinder, Raytheon AMRAAM, Raytheon Sparrow, MBDA (formerly Matra BAe Dynamics) Skyflash and ASRAAM, and the MBDA R550 Magic 2. In April 2004, the F-16 first fired the new-generation AIM-9X Sidewinder, which is in full-rate production for the USAF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Air-to-surface missiles carried on the F-16 include Maverick, HARM and Shrike missiles, manufactured by Raytheon, and anti-ship missiles include Boeing Harpoon and Kongsberg Penguin.

The F-16 was the first USAF aircraft to be fitted with the joint stand-off weapon (JSOW) in April 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The F-16 can be fitted with Lockheed Martin wind-corrected munitions dispenser (WCMD), which provides precision guidance for CBU-87, -89, and 97 cluster munitions. The system corrects for launch transients, ballistic errors, and winds aloft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The F-16 is the first aircraft to use the USAF&rsquo;s new weapon rack, the Edo Corporation BRU-57. The BRU-57 is a vertical ejection rack which doubles the aircraft&rsquo;s capacity for precision-guided weapons such as the JDAM and WCMD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All-weather stand-off weapons such as the AGM-84E stand-off land-attack missile (SLAM) and the AGM-142 Popeye II are planned to be included in future upgrades to the aircraft. Other advanced weapons include MICA, IRIS-T, Python IV, Active Skyflash air-to-air missile, ALARM antiradiation missile, Apache multimission stand-off weapon, autonomous free-flight dispenser system and AS30L laser-guided missile.</p>\r\n', '2019-04-27 19:27:34', 'static\\images\\f16-2.jpeg');
